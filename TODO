support variables without =

support --set,--merge of #commented name=value
with operation configured with --comment = {always,unchanged}

support multiple files passed to --merge

possibly support --format=sh|json with --merge

possibly support multiple duplicate names per section
to support MultiStrOpt in openstack config files file example.
This could be interfaced using the --list=multiname option.
Also have --list autodetect multiline lists as used by yum like:
  name = val1, val2
         val3
I.E. split on a combo of [\n,]

possibly support --lower to output normalised case for
--get and --sort

support python3

Allow crudini to create files by default.
Override with --existing or also have --no-create?
Probably --no-create is better (more flexible)
Actually could have --existing take an optional
arg to control, with default meaning all.
That would be most flexible.
